#### Sample app to show basics of MVP + Dagger2 + RxJava + Retrolambda. This app is based off the app - [MVP with Dagger](https://github.com/sgzsh269/android-mvp-with-dagger2).
#### Compare the Presenters and the Data layer between the 2 apps to see the true benefit of RxJava and Retrolambda! 

#### The sample app fetches and displays the interesting photos and their comments for the most recent day from the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).
